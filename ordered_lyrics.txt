[Intro: Chris Martin & Choir, Moses Martin]
I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends

Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Rosaleem of the Damascene
Yes, she had eyes like the moon
Would have been on the silver screen
But for the missile monsoon
She went, woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
Indigo up in heaven today
Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
With bombs going boom ba-boom-boom
She say

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Choir]
I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and be young again

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Baba would go where the flowers grow
Almond and peach trees in bloom
And he would know just when and what to sow
So golden and opportune
He went, woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
Tulips the colour of honey today
It's true true, woo woo oo-oo-oo
With bombs going boom ba-boom-boom
He say
